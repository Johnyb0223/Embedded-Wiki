# Objective
The objective of this repository/wiki is to encompass everything related to Embedded Systems. The field of Embedded Systems is vast and demanding, requiring a broad spectrum of knowledge to truly excel or maybe just survive! It is an area that thrives on curiosity, persistence, and patience. Our goal is to cultivate a supportive community that serves as a valuable resource for embedded developers at all levels. Through this platform, we aim to provide guidance, share projects, offer comprehensive explanations, and explore the "how," "why," and "when" of embedded concepts.

# Motivation
If you're familiar with embedded systems, you possess a certain curiosity that sets you apart. You find joy in questioning how and why things work, and the thought of a bookshelf filled with textbooks sparks excitement within you. Maybe these traits perfectly describe you or perhaps they only partially resonate with your personality. Nonetheless, understanding embedded systems implies acknowledging the extensive knowledge required to even scratch the surface of this domain. You've likely experienced the feeling of being overwhelmed and lost as you navigated through countless websites, sought answers from chatbot prompts, and watched numerous videos. Starting off can be daunting, with obstacles and challenges lurking at every turn. This is where our platform steps in, aiming to be a roadmap for newcomersâ€”a guiding light into the embedded world, whether it be a hobby, profession, or lifelong passion.

Our motivation behind this project is simple: to provide answers to your burning questions. We strive to offer in-depth explanations, accompanied by practical examples of embedded concepts. Additionally, this platform serves as a space to explore and share your own embedded projects with the community. Our vision is to build a one-stop shop for the embedded community, fostering an environment where knowledge is freely exchanged, collaboration flourishes, and expertise is nurtured.

# Vision
Our vision for this embedded systems wiki is to create a vibrant and inclusive community that empowers individuals to excel in the field. We envision a space where developers of all levels can come together to learn, share insights, and contribute to the collective understanding of embedded systems. By pooling our knowledge and experiences, we aim to build a comprehensive repository of resources, tutorials, and best practices. Through collaboration and open discussion, we strive to advance the field of embedded systems, pushing the boundaries of innovation and fostering a supportive environment for all.

# Contributing
We strongly believe that collaboration is the key to success in the embedded systems community.

To contribute to the Embedded-Wiki, please follow these steps:

+ Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
+ Create a new branch with a descriptive name for your contribution.
+ Make your changes, whether it's adding new content, correcting errors, or enhancing existing information.
+ Test your changes to ensure they are accurate and functional.
+ Submit a pull request, explaining the purpose and details of your contribution.

We will review your pull request and work together to incorporate your contributions into the main repository. Together, we can create a thriving resource that benefits the entire embedded systems community.

**Warning**: this will not be a repo/wiki full of half-baked projects/wiki pages. We expect all contributions to be well planned, executed, and documented. The idea is for these examples to stand the test of time and be applicable across toolchains, architectures, languages, and implementations. There should be a certain level of abstraction and explanation so one could take an example and apply it to a situation regardless of the tools used.

So, join us on this exciting journey into the world of embedded systems. Together
